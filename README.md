# AROM

AROM (Autonomous robotic observatory manager) is set of open-source software for control and management robotic observatories. Whole software is built upon system for controlling robots - ROS (Robotic operation system). 

AROM software is designed for use with small (amateur) telescope and fully autonomous observatories. It is going to work on simple single-board computers souch as Odroid. Software should be able to monitor all telescope states which may affect observing quality. This conditions are weather, air-quality, observatory status, mount position and many other conditions.
