\begin{abstract}

AROM (Autonomous robotic observatory manager) is set of open-source software for control and management robotic observatories. Whole software is built upon system for controlling robots - ROS (Robotic operation system). 

AROM software is designed for use with small (amateur) telescope and fully autonomous observatories. It is going to work on simple single-board computers as Odroid. Software should be able to monitor all telescope states which may affect observing quality. This conditions are weather, air-quality, observatory status, mount position and many other conditions.

\section{Introduction}
There are few systems for controlling robotics telescopes. Some of them are commercial and so expensive. They are usually made bespoke for one assembly. There are few open-source (or free) systems which are not well working. Mostly there are unable to control observatory in full autonomous mode.

\section{Goals}
The goals of this project are taken from the gained experience with observing and testing other systems

Main goals are following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimal maintenance requirements
\item Independent on control computer
\item Service-lees observing (robotic observing)
\item Self-calibration, self-diagnostic
\item Price affordability
\item Simple and intuitive operation
\item Multiple telescope observing
\item Open-source software, easily expandable
\end{itemize}

It can be said also as the observer will care only for the observations, but not about hardware or software problems. Whole management software also contains many useful tools for observing.

\subsection{Observing scheduler}
Scheduler is used to define observing plan. It can optimalise to use full observing times with the best conditions for objects as observing near meridian, shorter slewing, calculation raise and sets times for objects. Every target may have a set of observing condition as minimum height, list of times and next.

\subsection{Observing script}
Observing script defines parameters for capturing data from instruments. It must be part of observing, because it tells which device use and how. For example use main camera with exposure time 20 seconds. Use video-guiding with second camera and between every image change filter or try refocus main camera if it is necessary.

It can also contains algorithms for capturing HDR (high dynamics range) images, wide-field mosaics or calibration images (flat-field, dark-frame, bias).

\subsection{Movement limits}
Movement limits are safety mechanism to avoid telescope crash to observatory walls, roof or another equipment. There are two level of limits. First level is shadowed area where could be trees or building away. Limit of first level could be used for telescope slew. Second level limits are restricted areas where is danger of telescope crash.
Definition of these areas is done by vector (.svg) image. 

\subsection{Astrometry}
Astrometry is method for measurement star position. It can be used to accurate measure position of telescope and tune mount GoTo errors.

\subsection{Alignment and guiding}
Alignment tells us how accuracy is polar axis of mount established. Usually it contains calibrating process, which determines differences of mount coordinates and real coordinates at three points. This process may be replaced with astrometry and permanent guiding. 

Guiding is used for restriction of mount mechanical errors as periodic error or some mechanical deformations. It can replace standard alignment workflow and make it continuously.

\subsection{User interface}
User interface enables to the user comfortably controlling telescope and all devices. AROM user interface is main based web page which intuitively shows device state and drive options. It configuration of whole observatory assembly.

\includegraphics[width=85mm]{img/arom_ui.eps}
\caption{AROM control web page; mount overview.} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\pagebreak

Web user interface has the advantage in platform independence. Observer can control it from the computer only with web browser or via smart phone. 

The second important user interface is in a terminal. This type of remote control is useful in the cases of remote control via internet without public IP address or in networks with low transfer rate. Terminal user interface offers to the users full control without visual content as showing captured fields, sky map or stream from overview cameras.

\subsubsection{Control modes}
AROM will have three main control modes. First mode is the fully autonomous mode. It requires fully equipped observatory with a closable roof, weather station, cloud sensor, back-up batteries and more. Telescope is going to observe without any user interaction. It will observe object with pre-set object list and it will chose best target object. 

The second mode is manual mode. This mode is designed for use with free-standing telescope systems. The user specifies targets and system controls camera by own. AROM keeping the correct position specified by user.

The third mode is semi-automatic mode. This mode is automatic mode designed for free-standing telescopes. This mode requires operator for weather monitoring. Capturing of images is controlled by 'Observing scheduler' and 'Observing scripts'.

\section{ROS}
ROS is set of software tools for controlling robotic systems. For AROM is very important TCP/IP messaging system. TCP/IP messaging system provides communication between nodes. Node is a program which can communicate with other nodes. There are several types of messages. 

The first type of messages must have topic (name of message) and data. This message is created by publisher (node) on topic and received by subscriber with listening the same topic. This type of message can have more publishers and subscribers (N-N).

The second type of messages (services) is send from node to the specified node with same topic (N-1). After sending first message. The publisher will wait for answer. It is useful for getting state of the node.

The last type (activities) is designed for longer processes as some mechanical moving or long-running calculations. This message is non-blocking.

\section{AROM structure}
Software structure is designed to use ROS system. The main part of the software is the master node 'AROM\_brain'. Master node contains parametric server where values describing telescope, cameras, observing site, and other parameters are stored. 

In AROM scheme is every hardware device controlled by own node. Nodes are connected in hierarchical structure.

The hierarchical structure is important. The structure defines devices dependencies. For example we have a camera. Camera can move with focuser, field rotator, filter wheel or some other camera's equipment. These devices are controllable only from camera driver (node). This structure ensures independent controlling of the more same devices. see \texttt{Fig. 2.}.
 
There are exist nodes, which can not be included in hierarchical structure. These are observatory state monitor node, guiding node, software for validating image, software for saving images to the network storage, etc.

Some data as weather condition could be shared through network from another AROM setup.

\subsection{Configuration}
Structure should be defined in observatory .xml configuration file. Here is described every device used in setup. This file is useful for automatic starting of system. Device drivers (nodes) could be also loaded/killed later.

\end{figure}


\section{Database}
All system requires database for storage data as weather during the observation, catalogue of objects, observed data, observation logs, observing scripts. Database can be shared between multiple observatories. Database is be based on MySQL framework.

Object database must be able to save multiple types of objects as stars, planets, comets, asteroids, satellites, etc. Example of database structure for storing object is shown in table \texttt{Table 1.}

\section{Safety system}
Safety system is the most important part of whole system. It protect equipment from the destruction. Damage may be caused by many circumstances, such as as crash telescope into other observatory equipment or damage camera by high temperature. This system may prevent even just dust on optical parts. 

\section{Conclusion}
Even today in the time of the various technology there is no well usable system for robotization various small observatories or amateur telescopes. AROM is prides on openness, simply extensibility, support of various hardware, and intuitiveness for operator. AROM allows control of simple free-standing telescope setups as well as complex observatories. AROM system could be used also on the radiotelescopes.
